## Description

This is a Udacity Front End Nanodegree project.

## Run

Download the zip file or clone via Github and then open the Ã¬ndex.html file.

Or you can play the game here: https://apekos.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/.

## Instructions

* Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the player.
* The player must reach to the water.
* Every time the player reaches the water he gets a point and moves back to the start position.
* The player has 3 lives. Every time he crashes onto any of the bugs he looses one life.
* The game is won when the player gets 5 points. 


## Credits

* I have used the sweetalert modal from: https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/#installation.
